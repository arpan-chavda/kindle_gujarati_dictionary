Developer Guide
===============

#### Layout

* src: Source of dictionary.
* tools: Contains some scripts to build dictionary.
* screenshots: Some cool screenshots.

#### Linux

a. Clone this repository.

b. Install stardict-tools and wine:

```
sudo apt-get install stardict-tools wine
```

c. Open stardict-editor through terminal.

d. Decompile using stardict-editor (input: ifo file). This will generate one
text file.

e. Once you have this file, use tab2opf.py from tools folder or download it
from [here](http://www.klokan.cz/projects/stardict-lingea/). This is a free
Python script by Petr Klokan. You can also get this file using script from
tools folder,
```
./get_tab2opf.py
```
f. Run:
```
python tab2opf.py -utf dictionary.txt
```
This will give you a dictionary.opf file and a number of dictionary0.html files.

Or you can use script,
```
./tab2opf.sh
```
which will execute steps e and f.

g. Edit the dictionary.opf file to specify the name of the dictionary and the
input/output output languages.

h. You can use opf2mobi.sh script to get mobigen.exe from:
[mobigen](http://www.mobipocket.com/soft/prcgen/mobigen.zip), extract it and
convert it to mobi format using wine. You can also follow steps in script
manually yourself.

To run script,
```
./opf2mobi.sh dictionary.opf
```
Where dictionary is your OPF file generated by tab2opf.py script.

i. If everything goes right, you will get dictionary.mobi whichâ€™ll be the
Gujarati dictionary for Kindle.

j. You can port other dictionaries to Kindle. Some dictionary files are
available from: http://stardict.sourceforge.net/Dictionaries.php

#### Windows

Above instructions will also apply for Windows, but it has 3 more steps before
we can proceed.

a. Clone this repository.

b. Install Stardict editor from: http://stardict.sourceforge.net/other.php

c. Install Python.

UTF-8 encoding problem
======================

Kindle does not support inbuilt UTF-8 support.

a. You can convert .mobi file to .azw or you can directly produce azw file.

b. You must have to embbed Gujarati Unicode font (Any one: Shruti, Lohit
Gujarati, Samyak, Aakar)

c. Transfer your dictionary to Kindle and test it whether it works or not.

d. PS: I have tried above things but not succeeded in producing azw format yet.
